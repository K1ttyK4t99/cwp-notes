| **Speed** | 106–424 kbps | 1–3 Mbps (up to 2 Mbps in v5+) | 100 Mbps–1+ Gbps |
| **Pairing** | Instant tap-to-pair | Requires setup process | Network authentication |
| **Power Usage** | Very low | Moderate | High |
| **Use Cases** | Payments, ID access, smart tags | Audio, file sharing | Internet access |

> **Each technology has specific strengths** — NFC excels at security and ease for short-range tasks, Bluetooth for personal connectivity, and Wi-Fi for data-intensive use.

---

#### NFC Security Risks

| Threat | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Eavesdropping** | Intercepting data if encryption is not used. |
| **Data Corruption** | Altering or disrupting transferred NFC data. |
| **Relay Attacks** | Forwarding intercepted data to another device to gain unauthorized access. |
